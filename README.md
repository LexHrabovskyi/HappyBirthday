I see some places I can make a review and write a better solution.
For example, the second screen can be smashed into 3 VCs, for showing child's data (name, age), controlling photo drawing and the main one, which will hold all of them.
But the task was bigger than I thought, and it took more time than I expecting. IMHO here I showed my style and approach to work. 

Also in git, I used both: merge and squash (the second I prefer more). I didn't delete the branches, so you can see all the developing story.

I hope It'll be pleasant to read my code =)
Anyway the feedback is desirable.
